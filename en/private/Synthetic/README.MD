Here are the private and Synthetic files of the training set.

Content:

- Synthetic 1, which contains the word BI followed by 8 digits, which could mean that it was the number of someone's identification card (from Portugal).

- Synthetic 2, which contains the word cc, with 8 digits in the cell below, which leads to wanting that is the number of someone's citizen's card (from Portugal).

- Synthetic 3, which has certain words that may mean that there is private information in this file, such as the phrase "born in".

- Synthetic 4, which has phrases that indicate the possibility of the existence of private information, for example CC with 8 digits ahead, which may indicate that the number of someone's citizen's card (from Portugal) is present.

- Synthetic 5, a file that has some factors that may be private, such as bi with 8 digits at the right side, which may mean that a person's identification card number (from Portugal) is present.

- Synthetic 6, similar to Fictitious file 5 but with the number of 8 digits before the initials bi.

- Synthetic 7, which has several words / phrases that can mean the presence of private information, having also the initials B.I. which by having 8 digits in the bottom line may mean that it is a number of an identification card (from Portugal).

- Synthetic 8, this file is considered private since it has the phrase "born". It also has the initials NIF (TIN in Portugal), but since near the initials there is no number with 9 digits, it is not private information.

- Synthetic 9, is considered private because it has C.C. (Citizen Card in Portugal) with 8 digits behind and NIF (TIN in Portugal) with 9 digits across, with also the phrase "born". Which leads to consider that the file has personal information.

- Synthetic 10, is similar to the Fictitious 9 file but with 9 digits ahead of the acronym NIF (TIN in Portugal).

- Synthetic 11, similar to the fictitious file 4, but with the 8 digits behind the acronym cc (Citizen Card in Portugal).
 
- Synthetic 12, which contains the acronym nif (tin in Portugal) with 9 digits in the line below, which may mean that the Tax Identification Number is present.

- Synthetic 13, which has the phrase "born" which by itself already indicated that the file is probably private, however also has C.C. with 8 digits behind (Citizen Card in Portugal). The word social as it does not have a number of 11 digits (Social Security Number in Portugal) close does not bring concern regarding being private.

- Synthetic 14, similar to the Fictitious 13 file, however the 8-digit number is ahead of the acronym C.C (Citizen Card in Portugal).

- Synthetic 15, which has the social word and the acronym C.C but as there is no number of 11 (Social Security Number in Portugal) and 8 digits (Identity Card in Portugal), respectively. In these conditions the file is considered private since it also contains the word "born", which suggests that this file contains someone's date of birth.

- Synthetic 16, which is similar to the file Ficticio 13, but with the difference that the number of 8 digits is above the acronym C.C ..

- Synthetic 17, similar to Fictitious file 15 but with the acronym CC instead of C.C ..

- Synthetic 18, similar to the file Ficticio 13 but with the number of 8 digits under the acronym.

- Synthetic 19, with several potentially private elements, such as social, having a number of 11 digits ahead.
